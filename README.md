Chess-Board
===========

Objective is to get minimum number of steps for a Knight to reach far right hand side corner. Also trace the path he travels.


For example : If we have a 3 X 3 chessboard, (x,y) represents the Knight's initial position.

1) If (x,y) is (2,2), an exception needs to be thrown as a Knight starting at that place can never reach (3,3).
2) If (x,y) is (1,1), the minimum number of moves in which it reaches (3,3) is 4 and the path also will be printed out.

The solution provided is scalable and is not limited to a 3 X 3 chessboard.
